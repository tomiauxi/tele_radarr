# Go-Powered Telegram Bot for Radarr Movie Management
This Telegram bot is specifically designed for movie management through Radarr, a movie collection manager. It enables users to execute a range of commands for searching, adding, editing, deleting, and organizing movies within their Radarr library. Developed in Go, the bot operates with minimal resource consumption, utilizing less than 10 MB of RAM. It maintains a stateless operation and does not persist data to disk, except for error logs. The Docker image size is efficiently kept under 10 MB (compressed), supporting multiple CPU architectures including `arm32v7`, `arm64v8`, and `x86_64`/`amd64`.

This bot is built using [golift/starr](https://github.com/golift/starr/) and [go-telegram-bot-api/telegram-bot-api](https://github.com/go-telegram-bot-api/telegram-bot-api/) without any additional dependencies.

### Start Bot
<img src="screenshots/start.png?raw=true" alt="q1" title="start" width="300" />

### Search and Add Movies
``/q [movie]`` or just type the movie's title: Search for a movie.\
Once a movie is found, the bot offers options to add the movie to your Radarr library along with various monitoring settings. If you have only one root folder and one quality profile, the bot will automatically select the first option for you. However, if multiple choices exist, you will be prompted to select a root folder and a quality profile. If you have tags defined in Radarr, you can select them as well.

Furthermore, you can monitor/unmonitor a movie, search for it, and delete it. Movie/title is optional. If omitted, a filter menu is shown.
